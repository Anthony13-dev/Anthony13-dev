I am a Solution Architect with 17+ years of experience in designing, modernizing, and delivering scalable enterprise applications. I specialize in cloud-native architecture, modernization of legacy systems, and mentoring high-performing development teams. My expertise spans .NET, Blazor WebAssembly, microservices, PostgreSQL, cloud platforms (Azure, GCP), and DevOps transformation.

Key strengths:
- End-to-end architecture design for enterprise-grade web and cloud applications.
- Driving modernization of legacy systems to Blazor/.NET 9+ with scalable backends on PostgreSQL and Kubernetes (GKE).
- Guiding DevOps transformation from Jenkins to GitHub Actions CI/CD.
- Hands-on leadership: mentoring developers on SOLID principles, TDD, Blazor best practices, and architectural patterns.
- Bridging business and engineering through clear communication and solution alignment.

I believe in building systems that are resilient, performant, and maintainable—and teams that are empowered, collaborative, and technically excellent.

Proficient in Python, ASP.NET, .NET Core, C#, and Blazor webassembly. Currently expanding expertise in Data Science, Machine Learning, and Generative AI through hands-on projects or proof of concepts and certifications. Passionate about applying emerging technologies to drive operational excellence, solution innovation, and measurable business value.
